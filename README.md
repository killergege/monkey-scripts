A collection of all my Greasemonkey scripts.

## How To Install

All scripts can be installed through the same steps:

1. Install a userscript manager, for example:

* [Greasemonkey](http://www.greasespot.net/)
* [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net)
* [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/get-it/)

2. Go to the folder of the script that you want to install and click on "Install".
